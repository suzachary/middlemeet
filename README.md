# middlemeet
With millions of college students sent home during the pandemic, some form of social interaction has never been more needed. This is where MiddleMeet comes in- a web application that allows people to meet up safely and effectively. A new innovation in the social scene, MiddleMeet uses an advanced equidistant algorithm to allow people to 'meet in the middle' of their current locations - hence the name. It then suggests the best activities in this area- hikes, restaurants, parks, and more, all based on thousands of submitted reviews. Meet up with college friends you haven't seen since last year, with relatives that always push you to visit them, or with old high school buddies you havenâ€™t seen since AP Gov, all while making sure no one has to drive farther than the other. With the planning left in our hands, all that's left on you is to have fun!
